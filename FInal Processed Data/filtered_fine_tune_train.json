Nervousness, anxiety and irritability. Tremor, usually a small trembling in the hands and fingers. Sweating. Changes in menstrual cycles. Increased sensitivity to heat.

Or they may vomit, have a fever and cough, appear restless or tired and without energy, or have difficulty breathing and eating. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher, or persistent cough, especially if you're coughing up pus. It's especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a doctor:  Adults older than age 65 Children younger than age 2 with signs and symptoms People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system People receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system  For some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems, pneumonia can quickly become a life-threatening condition.",

Erythrodermic psoriasis The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover the entire body with a peeling, itchy rash. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover the entire body with a peeling, itchy rash. Common signs and symptoms of psoriasis include:  A patchy rash that varies widely in how it looks from person to person, ranging from spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions over much of the body Rashes that vary in color, tending to be shades of purple with gray scale on brown or Black skin and pink or red with silver scale on white skin Small scaling spots (commonly seen in children) Dry, cracked skin that may bleed Itching, burning or soreness Cyclic rashes that flare for a few weeks or months and then subside  There are several types of psoriasis, each of which varies in its signs and symptoms:  Plaque psoriasis. The most common type of psoriasis, plaque psoriasis causes dry, itchy, raised skin patches (plaques) covered with scales. There may be few or many. They usually appear on the elbows, knees, lower back and scalp. The patches vary in color, depending on skin color. The affected skin might heal with temporary changes in color (post inflammatory hyperpigmentation), particularly on brown or Black skin. Nail psoriasis. Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Severe disease may cause the nail to crumble. Guttate psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis primarily affects young adults and children. It's usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It's marked by small, drop-shaped, scaling spots on the trunk, arms or legs. Inverse psoriasis. Inverse psoriasis mainly affects the skin folds of the groin, buttocks and breasts. It causes smooth patches of inflamed skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis, a rare type, causes clearly defined pus-filled blisters. It can occur in widespread patches or on small areas of the palms or soles. Erythrodermic psoriasis. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover the entire body with a peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely. It can be short-lived (acute) or long-term (chronic). ",
